# Web Scraping Homework - Mission to Mars

![mission_to_mars](Images/mission_to_mars.png)

In this assignment, we have built a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page.

Python with Splinter, BeautifulSoup, and Pandas, and MongoDB were used to scrape and store the required data, and Python with Flask was used to automate those processes. HTML with Bootstrap CSS was used to generate and format the completed webpage presenting the scraped data.

## Step 1 - Scraping

Complete your initial scraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter.



### NASA Mars News

* Scrape the [NASA Mars News Site](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/) and collect the latest News Title and Paragraph Text. Assign the text to variables that you can reference later.

```python
# Example:
news_title = "NASA's Next Mars Mission to Investigate Interior of Red Planet"

news_p = "Preparation of NASA's next spacecraft to Mars, InSight, has ramped up this summer, on course for launch next May from Vandenberg Air Force Base in central California -- the first interplanetary launch in history from America's West Coast."
```

### JPL Mars Space Images - Featured Image

* Visit the url for JPL Featured Space Image [here](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/?search=&category=Mars).

* Use splinter to navigate the site and find the image url for the current Featured Mars Image and assign the url string to a variable called `featured_image_url`.

* Make sure to find the image url to the full size `.jpg` image.

* Make sure to save a complete url string for this image.
